# soda-alerts
Allows one to get email alerts using the Socrata Open Data API. Other hooks to consider adding are Twitter Bots and Web Hooks and Websockets.

To make this lightweight I decided against using a real database and CRON.

1. Copy configuration_example.json to configuration.json and fill in the details
2. Run app.py and get_data.py
